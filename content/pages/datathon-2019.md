# Data Science for Scientists ATL 2019 Datathon
## Overview

The Atlanta metro area faces public health challenges that are unique to the South.
In this data science competition, teams will use data and tools from researchers at 
Atlanta universities and their collaborators to provide unique insights into how we 
can address the public health issues that we face. After presenting, the teams will 
receive feedback from a group of judges with extensive experience applying data science 
to research problems in academia and industry. In addition to the opportunity to 
network, all teams will walk away with a project they can add to their data science portfolio.
