Yesterday our group got a very cool #dataviz tutorial from [Trent Ryan](https://trent.netlify.com/), a graduate student advised by [Timothy Dowd](http://sociology.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/dowd-tim.html) in [Sociology at Emory](http://sociology.emory.edu/home/index.html). Trent walked us through using the [Leaflet library](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet), for making interactive maps, together with the R package [tidycensus](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus) that provides easy access to United States census data.

He put together a blog post to walk us through the tutorial. Since Trent is of Iranian descent, he was curious to see where Iranians are in the United States. This post contains cool visualizations, explains why you can only get dried sour cherries in California, and provides good evidence for why one of the best Persian restaurants (Rumi's) in Georgia is in Roswell.

#### Bonus links to things that came up during Trent's tutorial:

- Julia Silge post that Trent based his tutorial on, "read this one because the code is very clean": https://juliasilge.com/blog/using-tidycensus/  
- blog of Kyle Walker, developer of tidycensus, with "many good posts on GIS": https://walkerke.github.io/  
- Can we stay in Python (for its "data-wrangling strengths") but still get the benefits of Leaflet.js for interactive mapping? Claro que yes! There's a library called folium: https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/
