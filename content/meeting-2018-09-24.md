For this meeting, Christian McDaniel and Andrew Durden from
[Shannon Quinn's group](https://quinngroup.github.io/) at UGA made the 
hike over to the ATL to talk with us about the projects they presented 
at [SciPy 2018](https://scipy2018.scipy.org/ehome/index.php?eventid=299527&). 

## "Developing an LSTM Pipeline for Accelerometer Data." Christian McDaniel
Christian gave us the low-down on the pipeline he developed to benchmark
recurrent neural networks that recognize different types of human activity 
from accelerometer data recorded from cell phones.
Check out the SciPy proceedings paper and code here:

Also check out the [presentation he shared with us](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Scientists-ATL/meeting-09-24/blob/master/accelstm/accelstm_qrg_presF18%20slides.pdf)
for lots of helpful pointers to info, tutorials, etc. about machine learning,
in particular about LSTMs and other types of recurrent neural networks.

## "Dynamic Social Network Modeling of Diffuse Subcellular Morphologies." Andrew Durden
Andrew talked with us about how he's building tools to track changes 
in sub-cellular structures that have until now been hard 
to analyze because of their diffuse structure, such as mitochondria and actin.
Their pipeline OrNET addresses this gap by leveraging the power of social network 
analysis in combination with other tools from image analysis and 
computer vision. You can read the Proceedings paper here:

And for some updates on how the work has progressed, 
see [Andrew's presentation which he kindly shared](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Scientists-ATL/meeting-09-24/blob/master/Ornet_slides/Dynamic%20Social%20Network%20Modeling%20of%20Diffuse%20Subcellular%20Morphologies.pdf).
