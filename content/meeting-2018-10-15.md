For this meeting, our first as a group since being chartered by Laney 
 Graduate School(!), Desiree DeLeon (Sanchez + Young labs) gave us 
a hands-on tutorial about what pseudoreplication is and how to avoid it.  
Check out her presentation here:

Desiree also shared an excellent 
[RMarkdown document](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Scientists-ATL/Pseudoreplication/blob/master/Data_sci_pseudoreplication%20copy.Rmd)
she put together that walks you through examples of pseudoreplication and
how to handle it statistically using R.
