Continuing our streak of R-based meetings, this month we learned about
scraping the web in R.  
Our guest speaker was Steve Pittard, a lecturer in Biostatistics 
and Bioinformatics at Emory, [among other things](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-pittard-925645b6/).
Steve helpfully shared a manuscript he's put together in Bookdown that
walks us through the lessons he's developed:

Several group members commented on how the same sort of analyses he applied to posts scraped 
from dialysis patient forums could be translated to other fields.
Its not always clear how well the views presented in clinical literature 
align with sentiments expressed by patients.  
Thanks, Steve, you gave us plenty of food for thought!
